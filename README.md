This repository is my entire journey through learning
the [clojure programming language](https://clojure.org/about/rationale).

Here you'll find exercises, course lecture notes, small projects, etc.

Special thanks:

- [Clojure Camp](https://clojure.camp) - for the excellent exercises.
- [Clojure Brasil](https://clojurebrasil.com.br) - for the excellent specific content for deepening the language and
  ecosystem.
